# Glass Gift Shop

A single-page micro shop built with the Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS. The shelf features twelve luminous curios, each marked with a frosted, pixel-glass icon and priced between one and five dollars. Wallet connectivity and checkout flows are powered by the Base Account SDK with automatic Sub Accounts and spend permissions.

## Features

- âœ¨ Frosted glass aesthetic with a responsive card grid for twelve curated products
- ðŸ‘œ Inline cart controls with add-to-cart and Base-powered checkout from every product
- ðŸ§Š Real Base Account SDK integration that provisions Sub Accounts on connect and enables auto spend permissions
- ðŸ“¦ Configurable metadata, paymaster routing, and Base network selection via environment variables

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the Base environment details you want to use. The keys below are optional but unlock richer branding and RPC routing when supplied.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=base-sepolia
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_APP_NAME=Glass Gift Shop
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_APP_LOGO=https://glass-gift-shop.vercel.app/icon.png
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PAYMASTER_URL=https://your-paymaster.example
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` may be set to `base` for mainnet or `base-sepolia` for testnet.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL` overrides the default RPC URL for the chosen network.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_APP_NAME` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_APP_LOGO` customize the metadata surfaced in the Base Account connect dialog.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PAYMASTER_URL` configures an optional paymaster endpoint for the Base Account SDK.

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to browse the shelf, add items to your cart, and connect a Base account.
